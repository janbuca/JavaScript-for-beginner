    JavaScript If...Else Statements
        Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
        Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.
        You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.
        In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
        Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
        Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
        Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
        Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

        The if Statement
        Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.
        Syntax:
        if (condition) {
        block of code to be executed if the condition is true
        }

        Note that if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate a JavaScript error.
