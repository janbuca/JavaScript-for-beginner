    JavaScript For Loop
        Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.
        Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
        Often this is the case when working with arrays:

    Different Kinds of Loops
        JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
            for - loops through a block of code a number of times
            for/in - loops through the properties of an object
            while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
            do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

    The For Loop
        The for loop has the following syntax:
        for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
        code block to be executed
        }

            Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
            Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
            Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
