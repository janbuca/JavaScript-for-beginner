JavaScript Introduction 
    - JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
    - JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
    - JavaScript is easy to learn.
    - This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.
Why Study JavaScript?
    JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
        1. HTML to define the content of web pages
        2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
        3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages


Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used.
    - Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript.
    - Node.js is the best known.
    - Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.

JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

What can JavaScript Do?
    * Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:
        - Things that should be done every time a page loads
        - Things that should be done when the page is closed
        - Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
        - Content that should be verified when a user inputs data


Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:
    - HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
    - HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
    - You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
    - You can prevent events from being sent or being handled

JavaScript where To?
    * internal(in HTML) and 
        - In Head Section and 
        - In Body Section
    * external (linked via <script> tag)

JavaScript display positivities
    - javascript can be display data in different ways:
        - Writing into an HTML element, using "innerHTML".
        - Writing into the HTML output using "document.write()".
        - Writing into an alert box, using " window alert()" function for simple messages.
        - Writing into the browser console, using "Console.log()".

where is the position of JavaScript?
    The <script> Tag
    In HTML, JavaScript code must be inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
    <script>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
    </script>

JavaScript in <head> or <body>
    You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
    Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

    JavaScript in <head>
        In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <head> section of an HTML page.
        The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked.

        JavaScript in <body>
            In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <body> section of an HTML page.
            The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked.


External JavaScript
    Scripts can also be placed in external files:
    External file: myScript.js
    function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Programer by Janbuca.";
        }

External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.
JavaScript files have the file extension .js.
To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
Example
<script src="myScript.js"></script>

You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.

The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located.
External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.

External JavaScript Advantages
    Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:
    It separates HTML and code
    It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain

To add several script files to one page - use several script tags:
Example
<script src="myScript1.js"></script>
<script src="myScript2.js"></script>
