Why Study JavaScript?
    JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
        1. HTML to define the content of web pages
        2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
        3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages


Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used.
    - Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript.
    - Node.js is the best known.
    - Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.

JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

What can JavaScript Do?
    * Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:
        - Things that should be done every time a page loads
        - Things that should be done when the page is closed
        - Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
        - Content that should be verified when a user inputs data


Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:
    - HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
    - HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
    - You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
    - You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
